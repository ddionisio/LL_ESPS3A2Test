    "intro_0": "Welcome!",
    "intro_1": "This world looks rather gloomy…we ought to brighten things up!",
    "intro_2": "Well, for that to happen we need the mighty Aries…who is currently asleep over there.",
    "intro_3": "In order to wake him up, we’re going to need to give him some energy!",
    "intro_4": "Energy provides us the power to act, and the ability to change. Though Aries is a bundle of energy, he is currently at rest.",
    "intro_5": "It looks like it’s up to you to take action! With your own energy, help the mighty Aries bring light to this world!",
    "level_1_intro_0": "Energy comes in many forms, and they have ways of moving about.",
    "level_1_intro_1": "We will start with light.",
    "level_1_intro_2": "Light is an energy made up of waves. Among many things, it can provide heat.",
    "level_1_intro_3": "Think of the sun as the biggest source of light energy, bringing sustenance to most living things.",
    "level_1_play_intro_0": "Here we have a spirit that provides light energy.",
    "level_1_play_intro_1": "In order for its light energy to move, we’ll need to rotate these contraptions.",
    "level_1_instruction_0": "Simply move the contraption like so!",
    "level_1_outer_complete_0": "Great! Now just one more, and the light shall shine through!",
    "level_1_inner_complete_0": "Excellent! Now that the light energy is free, why don’t we check back with the mighty Aries!",
    "level_1_victory_1_0": "As the warm light embraces Aries’s body, he begins to wake up!",
    "level_1_victory_2_0": "Thanks to your efforts, Aries is now full of energy!",
    "level_1_victory_3_0": "Now the mighty Aries can go forth to brighten up this world!",
    "level_1_victory_3_1": "Let’s help him out further by learning more about energy movements!",
    "level_2_intro_0": "Now we’ll be learning how to move light energy from one place to another.",
    "level_2_intro_1": "One neat thing about light is that it can bounce off of reflective surfaces like gems or mirrors.",
    "level_2_goal_1_intro_0": "Our task is to redirect the light energy towards this bell.",
    "level_2_gem_intro_0": "This gem here will bounce the light energy to where it points.",
    "level_2_gem_instruct_0": "Go ahead and place the gem into the indicated slot.",
    "level_2_gem_instruct_1": "Simply press the gem, and drag it into the slot as shown.",
    "level_2_gem_placed_0": "Excellent! As you can see, the light energy is bouncing off of the gem towards a direction.",
    "level_2_gem_next_0": "Now on to the next gem! Just like before, drag the object towards the indicated slot.",
    "level_2_gem_next_placed_0": "We’re almost there. Now we just need to adjust the direction of the light towards the bell.",
    "level_2_slot_instruct_0": "All you need to do is press and drag the lever to rotate the slot.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_0": "Excellent! Can you hear that? The bell is ringing joyously!",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_1": "Due to the light, the bell is able to vibrate causing it to make another type of energy: sound.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_2": "As you can see, we are able to change from one energy into another. From light to sound energy.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_3": "But of course, none of this is possible without your actions. Your own energy is what brings these to life!",
    "level_2_next_task_0": "Now to power up the remaining bell!",
    "level_2_next_task_1": "Just like before, place the gems into the slots, and redirect the light energy towards the bell.",
    "level_3_intro_0": "Now that we’ve seen energy as light, let’s take a look at energy as motion.",
    "level_3_intro_1": "Moving objects contain energy. When it hits another object, that energy is transferred.",
    "level_3_intro_2": "This is called energy of motion, also known as: kinetic energy.",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_0": "Let’s go check out how this energy of motion works!",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_1": "Pulling this spring plunger will allow it to push the rock.",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_2": "The further left you drag the handle, the more push it will give.",
    "level_3_push_platform_point_0": "Try to have the rock hit this platform. Remember to pull the spring plunger as far back as you can!",
    "level_3_task_first_complete_0": "Nicely done! As you can see, the energy of motion moved from one object to another.",
    "level_3_task_first_complete_1": "The energy released from the spring plunger has caused a series of movement, from one rock to another.",
    "level_3_goal_pointers_0": "Now let’s see if you can ring these other bells!",
    "level_3_rotate_pointer_0": "Let me adjust this so that it can hit the second platform!",
    "level_3_slider_pointer_0": "You’re going to need to adjust the position of this rock in order to hit both bells.",
    "level_3_go_0": "Well, it’s all up to you now! Good luck!",
    "level_4_intro_0": "Now we are going to look at another way to achieve energy from motion.",
    "level_4_water_0": "Here we have a spirit that provides us an everlasting flow of water.",
    "level_4_water_1": "The water’s motion will allow objects it touches to continuously move, thus providing a constant flow of energy.",
    "level_4_switch_instruct_0": "Press these two switches to divert the water’s flow towards the bell.",
    "level_4_goal_thing_0": "Excellent! So long as there’s water flowing, the bell will continue to ring.",
    "level_4_goal_other_pointers_0": "Now why don’t you go ahead and let the water flow towards the other bells!",
    "level_5_intro_0": "Here we are near the end of our journey!",
    "level_5_intro_1": "For this one, we will be powering up the bells with electricity.",
    "level_5_intro_2": "Electricity is a kind of energy that can move through conductive materials like metal.",
    "level_5_intro_3": "In this case, we are using copper wires.",
    "level_5_turbine_intro_0": "This is a turbine, a kind of machine that generates electrical energy by spinning magnets.",
    "level_5_turbine_intro_1": "In order to power the turbine, we will need lots of energy to move its blades.",
    "level_5_water_intro_0": "One way to do that is through steam from boiling water.",
    "level_5_water_intro_1": "By concentrating the steam through a narrow pipe, its energy will be strong enough to power the turbine.",
    "level_5_fire_intro_0": "Now in order to boil water, we will need energy to heat it up.",
    "level_5_fire_intro_1": "That’s where fire comes in. Fire releases energy that heats things up, also known as: thermal energy.",
    "level_5_coal_intro_0": "But in order to keep the fire going, we will need to feed it fuel.",
    "level_5_coal_intro_1": "Well, that’s what these coals are for. Coals provide fire with the energy to release heat.",
    "level_5_electric_explain_0": "Whew! That’s a lot of energy movement from one thing to another!",
    "level_5_electric_explain_1": "Now you’re wondering why go through all this trouble?",
    "level_5_electric_explain_2": "Well, electrical energy is really easy to move at a long distance. Think of the electrical poles around your home.",
    "level_5_electric_explain_3": "All that electricity comes from a place far away so it can have enough space to generate lots of energy!",
    "level_5_coal_interact_0": "Anyhow, let’s turn up the heat!",
    "level_5_coal_interact_1": "Go ahead and press the lever to feed the fire.",
    "level_5_power_first_active_0": "Nice! Here you see the whole process of energy moving from one thing to the next, and finally transforming into electricity.",
    "level_5_power_connect_instruct_0": "Now let’s power up that bell by attaching the power line into the socket.",
    "level_5_power_connect_instruct_1": "Simply drag the power plug into the socket as shown.",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_0": "Excellent! Now we just need to power up the rest of the bells!",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_1": "Though you may have noticed that only one of the power lines were able to receive electricity.",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_2": "Well, we’ll just have to fan the flame to make it release more heat!",
    "level_5_wind_intro_0": "We need to feed the fire with more oxygen so that it can burn through the coal faster, and produce more heat.",
    "level_5_wind_intro_1": "With more heat, the water will produce more steam, allowing it to turn the turbine’s fan faster.",
    "level_5_wind_instruct_0": "Simply press the wind fella multiple times until all the power lines are fully charged with electricity.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_0": "Excellent! With the turbine fully powered, you can now plug in the rest of the power lines.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_1": "Just like before, simply drag the power plug into one of the sockets that connects to the bell.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_2": "Also remember to keep the fire well fed with coal and oxygen!",
    "level_5_end_0": "Nicely done! With all the bells ringing, we have reached the end of our journey.",
    "level_5_end_1": "This concludes our lesson for energy movement!",
    "level_5_end_2": "Now go forth, and bring energy into the real world!",
    "end_thanks": "Thank you for playing!"

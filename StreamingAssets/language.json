    "intro_0": "Welcome! I’ve brought you to this world in order to set things right.",
    "intro_1": "As you can see, this place is rather gloomy.",
    "intro_2": "We need your help to bring energy to this world by waking up this sheep here called Aries.",
    "intro_3": "Now let us take to the skies, and activate the artifact to wake Aries up!",
    "level_1_intro_0": "Energy comes in many forms, and they have ways of moving about.",
    "level_1_intro_1": "We will start with light.",
    "level_1_play_intro_0": "Light is an energy made up of waves. It can travel through space and air.",
    "level_1_play_intro_1": "However, it is currently being blocked. Let’s fix that by turning these round contraptions.",
    "level_1_instruction_0": "Press and hold the highlighted lever, and move it towards the top.",
    "level_1_inner_complete_0": "As you can see, light can pass through the glass.",
    "level_1_inner_complete_1": "A glass is a kind of material that is highly transparent. Meaning you can see through it with ease.",
    "level_1_inner_complete_2": "Which makes sense, since our eyes can see things when there is light.",
    "level_1_outer_0": "Now we just need to turn the other contraption to allow the light to shine through!",
    "level_1_outer_complete_0": "Excellent! Now that the light energy is shining through, why don’t we check back down below.",
    "level_1_victory_1_0": "Filled with energy from the light, Aries is now ready to go!",
    "level_1_victory_2_0": "Let’s help him out further by activating the other artifacts in the sky.",
    "level_2_intro_0": "Now let’s take a look at how to move light energy from one place to another.",
    "level_2_intro_1": "One thing about light is that it can bounce off of reflective surfaces like mirrors.",
    "level_2_goal_1_intro_0": "Our task is to redirect the light energy towards this speaker.",
    "level_2_gem_intro_0": "This gadget has a reflective surface that will bounce the light towards where we want it to go.",
    "level_2_gem_instruct_0": "Press and drag the gadget towards the available slot.",
    "level_2_gem_placed_0": "Excellent! As you can see, the light is bouncing off of the reflective surface of the gadget.",
    "level_2_gem_next_0": "Go ahead, and place the next gadget like the previous one.",
    "level_2_gem_next_placed_0": "This time around, you’ll need to redirect the reflection towards the speaker.",
    "level_2_gem_next_placed_1": "To do that, you must press and drag the lever as shown.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_0": "Nice! As you can see and hear, the speaker is playing a tune.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_1": "Energy can be changed from one form into another.",
    "level_2_goal_1_reached_2": "In this case, the speaker is using light energy to power itself up to produce sound energy.",
    "level_2_next_task_0": "Now to power up the other speaker. Just like before, we need to redirect the light towards the speaker.",
    "level_3_intro_0": "Now that we’ve seen energy as light, let’s take a look at energy as motion.",
    "level_3_intro_1": "Moving objects contain energy. When it hits another object, that energy is transferred.",
    "level_3_intro_2": "This is called energy of motion, also known as: kinetic energy.",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_0": "Let’s go check out how this energy of motion works!",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_1": "Pulling this spring plunger will allow it to push the rock.",
    "level_3_plunger_instruct_2": "The further left you drag the handle, the more push it will give.",
    "level_3_push_platform_point_0": "Try to have the rock hit this platform. Remember to pull the spring plunger as far back as you can!",
    "level_3_task_first_complete_0": "As you can see, the energy of motion moved from one object to another.",
    "level_3_task_first_complete_1": "The energy released from the spring plunger has caused a series of movement, from one rock to another.",
    "level_3_goal_pointers_0": "Now let’s see if you can power up these speakers.",
    "level_3_slider_pointer_0": "You’re going to need to adjust the position of this rock in order to hit both bells.",
    "level_3_go_0": "Well, it’s all up to you now! Good luck!",
    "level_4_intro_0": "Now we are going to look at another way to achieve energy from motion.",
    "level_4_water_0": "Here we have a spirit that provides us an everlasting flow of water.",
    "level_4_water_1": "The water’s motion will allow objects it touches to continuously move, thus providing a constant flow of energy.",
    "level_4_switch_instruct_0": "Press these two switches to divert the water’s flow to power up the speaker.",
    "level_4_goal_thing_0": "As you can see, the water’s continuous flow is powering up the speaker.",
    "level_4_goal_other_pointers_0": "Go ahead and power up the other speakers by diverting more of the water’s flow!",
    "level_5_intro_0": "Here we are with our last sky artifact. We will be powering up the speakers with electricity!",
    "level_5_intro_1": "Electricity is a kind of energy that can move through conductive materials like metal.",
    "level_5_intro_2": "In this case, we are using copper wires.",
    "level_5_turbine_intro_0": "This is a turbine, a kind of machine that generates electrical energy by spinning magnets.",
    "level_5_turbine_intro_1": "In order to power the turbine, we will need lots of energy to move its blades.",
    "level_5_water_intro_0": "One way to do that is through steam from boiling water.",
    "level_5_water_intro_1": "By concentrating the steam through a narrow pipe, its energy will be strong enough to power the turbine.",
    "level_5_fire_intro_0": "Now in order to boil water, we will need energy to heat it up.",
    "level_5_fire_intro_1": "That’s where fire comes in. Fire releases energy that heats things up, also known as: thermal energy.",
    "level_5_coal_intro_0": "But in order to keep the fire going, we will need to feed it fuel.",
    "level_5_coal_intro_1": "Well, that’s what these coals are for. Coals provide fire with the energy to release heat.",
    "level_5_coal_interact_0": "Anyhow, let’s turn up the heat!",
    "level_5_coal_interact_1": "Go ahead and press the lever to feed the fire.",
    "level_5_power_first_active_0": "Here you see the whole process of energy changing from one thing to another, and finally into electricity.",
    "level_5_power_connect_instruct_0": "Now let’s power up that speaker by attaching the power line into the socket.",
    "level_5_power_connect_instruct_1": "Press and drag the power plug into the socket as shown.",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_0": "Excellent! Now we just need to power up the rest of the speakers!",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_1": "Though you may have noticed that only one of the power lines were able to receive electricity.",
    "level_5_goal_first_active_2": "Well, we’ll just have to fan the flame to make it release more heat!",
    "level_5_wind_intro_0": "We need to feed the fire with more oxygen so that it can burn through the coal faster, and produce more heat.",
    "level_5_wind_intro_1": "With more heat, the water will produce more steam, allowing it to turn the turbine’s fan faster.",
    "level_5_wind_instruct_0": "Press the wind spirit multiple times until all the power lines are fully charged with electricity.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_0": "Excellent! With the turbine fully powered, you can now plug in the rest of the power lines.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_1": "Just like before, press and drag the power plug into one of the sockets that connects to the bell.",
    "level_5_power_connect_all_2": "Also remember to keep the fire well fed with coal and oxygen!",
    "level_5_end_0": "Nicely done! With all the speakers powered up, we have activated the last artifact.",
    "level_5_end_1": "This concludes our lesson for energy movement!",
    "end_thanks": "Thank you for playing!",
    "test_0": "Testing"
